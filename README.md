Reddit bot to transcribe text from images to a post using OCR


This is a personal project for learning Python, so it could take some time to be even somewhat functional. At this moment my goal is to get the bot to fetch only the posts that link to an image. Afterwads the OCR module will be implemented. The idea is that any post containing an image with text would be fetched, scanned and the result posted as a comment.
